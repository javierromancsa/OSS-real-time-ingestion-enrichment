## KsqlDB
Confluent KsqlDB is the streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache KafkaÂ®. It provides an easy-to-use, yet powerful interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KsqlDB is scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and it supports a wide range of streaming operations, including data filtering, transformations, aggregations, joins, windowing, and serialization. You can use ksqlDB to build event streaming applications from Apache Kafka topics by using only SQL statements and queries. ksqlDB is built on Kafka Streams, so a ksqlDB application communicates with a Kafka cluster like any other Kafka Streams application.
